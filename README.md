## Introduction
NET.jl is a Julia library built for the sole purpose of working with elements of Non Equilibrium Thermodynamics(NET) principles in Julia. This library allows for the visulizaiton of certain phenomena, creation of Non Equilibrium thermodynamical systems, computation of Non Equilibrium Thermodynamics problems. The library mainly consists of 3 subsets, for the time being: Stohcastic Thermodynamics, Onsager Relations, Entropy Prodcution which are fundamental componenets of NET.

## Onsager Relations

Onsager relations are relations which express the relationship between fluxes and forces in a Thermodynamics system. Forces such as temperature gradients and concetration difference drive the fluxes, which are the determinanats of behaviors in the system, such as heat flux or diffusion (in the sense of movement of particles). 

There are 6 main files in the Onsager Relations subsection of the library.
