## Introduction
NET.jl is a Julia library built for the sole purpose of working with elements of Non Equilibrium Thermodynamics(NET) principles in Julia. This library allows for the visulizaiton of certain phenomena, creation of Non Equilibrium thermodynamical systems, computation of Non Equilibrium Thermodynamics problems. The library mainly consists of 3 subsets, for the time being: Stohcastic Thermodynamics, Onsager Relations, Entropy Prodcution which are fundamental componenets of NET.
